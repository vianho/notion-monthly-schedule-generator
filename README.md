# Notion Monthly Schedule Generator

## TODO
- Abstract out the date generator into 1 function.
- Check if schedule is already registered.
- Add end date so that we can get a gantt chart on notion, wheeeeeeeeee.
- Biweekly schedule generator (don't need it yet, have to check for previous record; it might be useful tho hmm).
- Fix the awkward date & time generator thing
- Log stuff pls.

## What is this? 
A script to create pages on notion to remind myself to keep in touch with people. 

## The Notion Table

## Why am I doing this?
It's some new year resolution thing...
Don't know how long I can keep this up tho :kek:

## Why is it so messy?
Because I was bruteforcing and now I'm too lazy to clean them up...

## Why is it so buggy?
Because I'm small brain ü§è

## Others
